        The shortest path is the path that takes the least amount of time.

        For instance, get_shortest_path('Stockwell', 'South Kensington') 
        should return the list:
        [Station(245, Stockwell, {2}), 
         Station(272, Vauxhall, {1, 2}), 
         Station(198, Pimlico, {1}),

         Station(229, Sloane Square, {1}),

        ]

        If start_station_name or end_station_name does not exist, return None.
        
        You can use the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path from
        start_station_name to end_station_name.

        Find a tutorial on YouTube to understand how the algorithm works, 
        e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE
        
        Alternatively, find the pseudocode on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm#Pseudocode

        Args:
            start_station_name (str): name of the starting station
            end_station_name (str): name of the ending station

        Returns:
            list[Station] : list of Station objects corresponding to ONE 
                shortest path from start_station_name to end_station_name.
                Returns None if start_station_name or end_station_name does not 
                exist.
                Returns a list with one Station object (the station itself) if 
                start_station_name and end_station_name are the same.
